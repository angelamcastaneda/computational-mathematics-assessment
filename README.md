# computational-mathematics-assessment

This assessment I completed as a student evaluates some topics in Computational Mathematics, as well as the use of python packages such as Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib. 

The questions are listed in the "CM-assessment-questions.ipynb" notebook and my solutions are written in the "Solutions.ipynb" notebook.
